# py2aqa32
Python Compiler to AQA Assembly as implemented by Peter Higginson at [https://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/AQA/](https://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/AQA/).

`main` branch should compile accurately but not optimally the code in `test_code.py`.

The official instruction set is found [here](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-75162-75172-ALI.PDF).
This compiler aims to run on the Peter Higginson simulator as documented [here](https://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/AQA/info.html). Note that he has expanded upon it to make a working simulation - if they ever differ the Higginson version is preferred.
